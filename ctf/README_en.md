# ðŸ§¨ CTFs & Wargames (English Version)

Welcome to the chaotic zone of digital mischief â€” aka my personal playground of hacking and crying.  

Here youâ€™ll find notes, flags, and occasional rants from battling the Bandit and friends.

## Templates â€” Because even chaos loves some order

- `template_bandit.md` â€” The no-BS English template for documenting your hacky adventures  
- `template_bandit_pl.md` â€” Polish version, for when you wanna feel fancy and complain in your native tongue

## How to Use This Madness

1. Copy one of the templates to a new file, e.g. `bandit_level1.md`  
2. Fill it out with your brain juice and tears  
3. Commit that glorious mess to the repo and flex on your fellow hackers
